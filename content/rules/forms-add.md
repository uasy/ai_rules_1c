# Adding or Modifying a Managed Form

This file owns the **rules**, not the MCP sequence. The pre-edit and post-edit MCP playbooks live in:

- `tooling-playbooks.md → Form Analysis and Generation` — full ordered list of MCP calls (`search_forms` → `inspect_form_layout` → `metadatasearch` → `get_xsd_schema` → write/modify XML → `verify_xml` → compile via the `1c-metadata-manage` skill).

Do not duplicate that sequence here.

## Rules specific to creating / modifying a form

- **The `1c-metadata-manage` skill (form-manage section) is the mandatory execution path** for creating or structurally modifying `Form.xml` — hard gate per `AGENTS.md → Skills and Subagents`; the skill drives the toolchain (BOM, encoding, UID generation, ordering of `ChildObjects`). Hand-editing is allowed only within the narrow exceptions of `content/skills/1c-metadata-manage/SKILL.md → Hard rule` (unambiguous one-line fix; skill not available — stated once).
- **XSD validation is mandatory** after any XML edit — `verify_xml` against the schema returned by `get_xsd_schema(object_type="Форма")`. A form that parses in your editor is not a form that loads in Designer.
- **Form-element naming.** Elements added to a typical form must carry the `{PREFIX}` prefix from `.dev.env`. Elements inside a newly created form (object already prefixed) do **not** repeat the prefix on every element — see `dev-standards-change-markers.md → "Metadata Naming"`.
- **Common pitfalls** are catalogued in `metadata-xml-workarounds.md` — read it before hand-editing the XML.
- **Region structure of the form module** — `module-structure.md → Form Module` (5 mandatory regions).

## Form-Presentation Rules

### Programmatic Modification of Typical Forms

All typical form modifications are performed **programmatically**, not visually. Elements are created in the `OnCreateAtServer` handler (or via subscription / extension).

### Placement of Added Elements

- If the form has tabs — add elements to a separate tab (e.g. "Additional" or with `{PREFIX}`).
- If no tabs — create a group without title for added elements.
- Typical form element names — with `{PREFIX}` prefix.

### New Forms (Non-Typical Objects)

- Separate header attributes and tabular sections into distinct tabs: "Main" (header), then one tab per tabular section.
- Fill "Header Data Path" property for pages with tabular sections.
- Reference fields — maximum width 27 characters.
- Multiline comment fields — width 79, height 3.

### Fill Checking

- Use "Fill check" property on form attributes.
- Before writing / posting, call `ПроверитьЗаполнение()`:

```bsl
Если Не ПроверитьЗаполнение() Тогда
	Возврат;
КонецЕсли;
```

### Form Commands

- When creating commands that modify data — enable "Modifies stored data" flag.

## Companion rules

| If the change also includes… | Also load |
|---|---|
| Event handlers (`ПриОткрытии`, `ПередЗаписью`, …), form-module logic, reserved names | `form-module.md` |
| Client-side async code (`Асинх` / `Ждать`) | `async-methods.md` |

This list is curated by the router file `forms.md`; load only the items you actually touch.
