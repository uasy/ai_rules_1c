# Subagents — catalog and delegation rules

**When to load this file:** if a task feels large / multi-step / multi-module and you suspect it is worth delegating to a specialized subagent — read this file, check the availability of a suitable subagent in the table below, and decide whether to delegate or execute directly.

## Delegation principle

14 specialized subagents are available in the project. Source prompt files live in `content/agents/` and use short file names without the `1c-` prefix:

| Subagent id | Source prompt file |
|---|---|
| `1c-explorer` | `content/agents/explorer.md` |
| `1c-analytic` | `content/agents/analytic.md` |
| `1c-extension-analyst` | `content/agents/extension-analyst.md` |
| `1c-planner` | `content/agents/planner.md` |
| `1c-architect` | `content/agents/architect.md` |
| `1c-arch-reviewer` | `content/agents/arch-reviewer.md` |
| `1c-developer` | `content/agents/developer.md` |
| `1c-metadata-manager` | `content/agents/metadata-manager.md` |
| `1c-refactoring` | `content/agents/refactoring.md` |
| `1c-performance-optimizer` | `content/agents/performance-optimizer.md` |
| `1c-error-fixer` | `content/agents/error-fixer.md` |
| `1c-tester` | `content/agents/tester.md` |
| `1c-code-reviewer` | `content/agents/code-reviewer.md` |
| `1c-doc-writer` | `content/agents/doc-writer.md` |

**Delegate when at least one countable fact holds:**

- the change touches **≥ 3 modules** or **≥ 2 metadata objects** (forms, layouts, roles and DCS schemas count as objects);
- an **independent read-only track** exists — exploration, impact listing or pattern search that `1c-explorer` can run while the parent continues, or a review the user explicitly requested;
- the task needs **≥ 5 files read** before the first edit or a **mechanical edit across ≥ 5 files** — the parent's context window is the bottleneck;
- `.dev.env` has `ORCHESTRATION=economy` (see below).

**Otherwise execute directly:** a single-file edit, or a full-cycle task under those thresholds, runs the 5-step Development Procedure from `AGENTS.md` plus the closing gate from `content/rules/verification-gates.md`. The pipeline in `subagent-pipeline.md` applies only when delegation is chosen here.

All 14 agents declare `allowParallel: true`. That licenses parallel **read-only** tracks; two mutating subagents run in parallel on one configuration only when their write scopes are provably disjoint — `subagent-pipeline.md → Stage 3`.

**Model profile.** The active-model profile (`AGENT_MODEL` in `.dev.env` — `content/rules/model-adaptation.md`) may tune **how eagerly** you delegate within these criteria: some models delegate too readily and their profile biases toward direct execution and low spawn counts, others sustain parallel subagents well and their profile encourages independent parallel tracks. The criteria above, the per-subagent "when NOT to call" column, the built-in-explorer ban, and every common obligation stay unchanged — a profile never adds a subagent the rules forbid, and never removes one they require. In particular, no profile authorises a subagent spawned to double-check your own work.

**Economy mode.** When `.dev.env` has `ORCHESTRATION=economy` (toggled by `/economymode`; empty / missing = `standard`), load `content/rules/orchestrator-economy.md`: delegation of execution becomes the default — the parent keeps decisions, specs, and verification, subagents do the reading and writing. Check the key when loading this file for a non-trivial task. The mode only widens delegation; every constraint of this file stays intact, and model selection still resolves from `SUBAGENT_MODEL_*` per tier.

## Host-tool built-in explorers (hard ban)

Cursor (and some other hosts) ship a **built-in** Explore helper — e.g. Cursor Task `subagent_type: "explore"` — with a fixed, non-overridable system prompt. That helper is **not** this project's explorer. It does not run the MCP-first fallback chain, does not prefer 1C graph / code-metadata tools, and does not return the structured report from `content/agents/explorer.md`.

**Hard rule for the parent:**

1. For any delegated read-only exploration that matches the `1c-explorer` row in the catalog below — launch **`1c-explorer`** (source: `content/agents/explorer.md`; installed custom agent under the active tool, e.g. `.cursor/agents/explorer.md`, `.claude/agents/explorer.md`, …).
2. **Do not** launch the host's built-in Explore / `explore` / generic codebase scout for that work. Prefer an explicit custom-agent invocation (`/1c-explorer …`, or the host's "use the 1c-explorer subagent" / Task launch by custom agent name) over a built-in `explore` type.
3. If the session's Task / subagent API only exposes built-in types and **cannot** start the installed `1c-explorer` — **do not** silently substitute built-in Explore. Either (a) run the exploration on the parent with MCP-first search, or (b) tell the user that `1c-explorer` is not launchable in this session. Falling back to built-in Explore is a defect.
4. `AGENTS.md` / project rules steer the **parent**; they do not rewrite the built-in Explore prompt — so "putting explore instructions in rules" is not a substitute for calling `1c-explorer`.

This ban is Cursor-shaped (built-in Explore is the common failure) but applies to **any** host-native generic explorer that bypasses the project agent prompt.

## Common obligations

Every subagent inherits `AGENTS.md` in full — its hard gates are not repeated in agent prompts. This section adds only what is **subagent-specific**; every agent prompt opens with a one-line preamble pointing here. Parent agents and subagent authors must not weaken any item.

### CONFUSION on material forks

Canon — `AGENTS.md → Development Procedure → 1. Think Before Coding` (triggers, format, low-risk assumption rule). Material fork = data integrity, transactions / posting, metadata shape, public contracts, security / RLS, anything hard to reverse, a conflict with existing code / БСП / `РежимСовместимости`, or an under-specified material edge case.

Subagent-specific: never resolve a material fork by silently picking one interpretation, returning a partial result, or paraphrasing the question into prose — raise the block and stop. Low-risk ambiguity: state the assumption in one line and proceed.

### MCP-first search

Canon — `content/rules/mcp-first-search.md` (chain graph → code-metadata → `grep=true` retry → native tools; bounded priority, not a ban). Tool routing and parameter names — `content/skills/mcp-1c-tools/SKILL.md`.

Subagent-specific: the chain binds subagents exactly as it binds the parent; when you fall back to a native discovery tool, state in the report which MCP attempts were tried and why they missed. `1c-arch-reviewer` and `1c-code-reviewer` have no Shell by design — their `Grep` / `Glob` only read sources the parent already pointed at, and any wider search is requested via the parent or `1c-explorer`.

### Metadata, infobase and repository hard gates (mutating agents)

Canon — `AGENTS.md → Skills and Subagents` (metadata mutations through the `1c-metadata-manage` skill, infobase operations through the slash commands / `db-ops`, repository operations through `1c-repository-manage`, vendor-support refusals); exceptions only per `content/skills/1c-metadata-manage/SKILL.md → Hard rule`.

Subagent-specific: the gates bind **every** mutating subagent, not only `1c-metadata-manager`. A `1c-developer` / `1c-error-fixer` / `1c-refactoring` / `1c-performance-optimizer` task that turns out to require a form or metadata change either drives it through the skill itself or reports it back to the parent for delegation — it never hand-edits the XML. In EDT projects (`.dev.env` `USE_EDT=true`) establish the source format before the first mutation and route per `content/rules/edt-workflow.md`; hand-editing `*.mdo` / `*.form` is a defect with no exception. Name the path used in the report: `Metadata tooling: …`, `EDT tooling: …`, `Repository tooling: …`.

### Validator chain (mutating agents)

Canon — `content/rules/verification-gates.md` (ordered hard gates: `syntaxcheck` → `check_1c_code` → `review_1c_code` → impact analysis → metadata XML validation, as applicable; graceful degradation when a validator is not exposed — the skip is recorded in the report, never silent). Retry budget — `content/rules/verification-policy.md → "Validator budget"`.

Subagent-specific: the agent that makes the final edit owns the validator run; for every mutated artifact report its content fingerprint, each applicable validator's result and run count **after the final edit**, and relevant execution context per `verification-gates.md → Gate execution and evidence reuse`. The parent reuses matching evidence instead of repeating validators on unchanged content. Read-only agents (`1c-explorer`, `1c-analytic`, `1c-arch-reviewer`, `1c-code-reviewer`, `1c-doc-writer` when not writing project sources, `1c-extension-analyst`) skip the mutating gates but follow every other item of this section.

### Scope and done criteria

- Edit only the files / objects in the assigned scope: no "while we're here" changes, no reverting or overwriting edits outside the scope, no deleting files without an explicit instruction — the subagent is not alone in the codebase.
- A real defect orthogonal to the assigned task (wrong logic, missing check, security or performance issue) is **reported** to the parent in the final report, never fixed within the task.
- Every assigned item is implemented or explicitly listed as not done. A plan that turns out wrong goes back to the parent as a `CONFUSION`; the subagent does not re-plan.
- If a criterion or a gate cannot be met, say so in the report — never present a partial result as complete.

### Handoff in / out (implementation subagents)

When one change is split across several implementation subagents (`1c-metadata-manager`, `1c-developer`, `1c-refactoring`, `1c-performance-optimizer`, `1c-error-fixer` — typical chain: metadata stubs first, BSL bodies next), the upstream subagent puts a fixed-format **Handoff** block at the very top of its final report. The parent's `## Upstream Handoff` copy preserves decisions and the reported artifact snapshot; current file contents remain the source of truth for the next edit. Parent-side forwarding rules — `subagent-pipeline.md → Stage 3 — Handoff between implementation subagents`.

**Handoff out** — emit whenever a further implementation subagent is expected (when unsure, emit). Machine-readable: one fact per line, ≤ 120 chars, no prose paragraphs; explanations belong in the report body.

```text
## Handoff for the next subagent

### Artifacts
- <full repo path> — <one-line role> [stub | done | edited]

### Verification evidence
- <file> — <content fingerprint> — <validator, result, run count>
- <relevant configuration / extension, platform / modes, source-to-IB match when applicable>

### Public surface
- <ObjectName>.<RoutineName>(<params>) → <return type> — <one-line purpose>
- <Metadata.Object> — <attribute / tabular section / form / command>: <type / role>

### Open TODOs / stubs for the next subagent
- <file>:<region or routine> — <what to implement> — <signature hint, if pre-agreed>

### Locked decisions (do not revisit without approval)
- <decision> — <one-line rationale>

### Open questions raised
- <CONFUSION-id> — <one-line summary> — <status: resolved / pending>
```

**Handoff in** — read `## Upstream Handoff` first; reuse its decisions, inventory and public-contract intent instead of rediscovering them. Before editing, read the current target fragment and the context needed to preserve intervening changes; a fingerprint check or targeted `Read` is normal work, not forbidden re-exploration. Reuse validation only when the current content fingerprint and relevant execution context match the recorded evidence (`verification-gates.md → Gate execution and evidence reuse`). A missing / changed fingerprint makes affected evidence stale: inspect the change and run only missing or invalidated gates. Additional discovery still follows `mcp-first-search.md`; avoid bulk re-reads of unchanged files. If current contents contradict a locked decision or public contract materially, raise `CONFUSION`; never overwrite another agent's edits or silently revise the decision.

### Report vocabulary

Severity of findings: `critical` (blocks delivery) / `major` (must be addressed or consciously accepted) / `minor` (informational). Status line: implementers report `✅ DONE / ⚠️ PARTIAL / ❌ BLOCKED`; reviewers and the tester report `✅ APPROVE / ⚠️ CONCERNS / ❌ BLOCK`. Each agent keeps its own report skeleton; no other scale is used.

### Shell and SDD

- Agents whose frontmatter lists `Shell` follow the `powershell-windows` skill for every shell command.
- If the project has an `openspec/` workspace — `content/rules/sdd-integrations.md` (MCP evidence for 1C facts, `Subagent → OpenSpec artifact mapping`, traceability updates after implementation).

## Subagent catalog

| Subagent | When to call | When NOT to call |
|---|---|---|
| **1c-explorer** | Read-only exploration across many files, metadata objects, dependencies, or "where/how/who calls" questions before planning, coding, or refactoring. **Mandatory** for delegated exploration — never the host built-in Explore (see *Host-tool built-in explorers*) | Narrow lookup that the parent can answer with one direct read/search; host-tool Cursor-guide / docs lookup (not 1C project source) |
| **1c-analytic** | User asks for a PRD, specification, or analysis of an existing area without writing code | Task is to write code |
| **1c-extension-analyst** | Auditing *why* a CFE extension modifies the base configuration — rationale report, pre-update risk review, scoping an extension down to its real footprint | Task is to edit the extension (use `1c-metadata-manager`/`1c-developer`) or a generic PRD/spec for new functionality (use `1c-analytic`) |
| **1c-planner** | A multi-step implementation or refactoring plan is needed before coding | Task is small enough that the plan is 1–2 lines |
| **1c-architect** | Designing the architecture of a sizable modification (new subsystem, integration, multi-module change) | Single-procedure or single-module change |
| **1c-arch-reviewer** | User asks to review or validate an architectural decision before implementation | No architectural design exists yet |
| **1c-developer** | Bulk code writing or modification across multiple modules that would otherwise drain the parent's context | Small local edit (Quick-fix path — see `AGENTS.md → Development Procedure`) |
| **1c-metadata-manager** | Creating, scaffolding, compiling, or multi-step / multi-domain metadata operations (objects, forms, reports, layouts, roles, extensions) | Single info lookup or single XML attribute fix — use a direct edit or the `1c-metadata-manage` skill |
| **1c-refactoring** | Dead-code cleanup, consolidation, or deduplication across multiple modules | Refactor is local to one procedure |
| **1c-performance-optimizer** | User reports slowness, or query / loop optimization is the explicit task | No performance concern was raised |
| **1c-error-fixer** | Quick fix of syntax / runtime errors / BSL LS warnings without architectural changes (tier `coding` — it authors production code, often on transactional paths) | The fix requires architectural rework — escalate to `1c-architect` / `1c-developer` |
| **1c-tester** | User asks to verify changes via deploy + UI automation against a test infobase, **and** `UI_TESTING` allows it (canon — `dev-standards-env.md`) | No test infobase; purely static task; `UI_TESTING=off`, or `manual` without an explicit UI-test request — never auto-trigger |
| **1c-code-reviewer** | **Only when the user explicitly asks for a code review** | Auto-triggering after edits is forbidden |
| **1c-doc-writer** | User-facing documentation: user guides, admin manuals, tutorials, codemaps, API references | Inline code documentation (module / procedure headers) — that is the developer's responsibility |

## Tool declarations

Like `modelTier`, the `tools` frontmatter of a source agent file is an **abstract vocabulary**, not a host tool list: `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Shell`, `MCP`. `Shell` means "may run shell commands" and `MCP` means "may call the project's MCP servers"; neither is a tool name in any AI client. The installer resolves the list into what the active tool actually understands — `disallowedTools` for Claude Code / Kimi / Qwen, `readonly: true` for Cursor, a `permission` object for OpenCode, dropped entirely for hosts that have no per-agent tool control (`AGENT-INSTALL.md → Lean placement`, step 4).

Two consequences for anyone editing these files or diagnosing a subagent:

- **Read the source list as capabilities, not as the session's tool inventory.** An installed agent may legitimately see more tools than its source list names (it inherits the parent pool minus the denied capabilities). What the list guarantees is the other direction: a capability the list withholds is denied.
- **Never "fix" a subagent by deleting its `tools` line.** That is how the read-only agents (`1c-explorer`, `1c-code-reviewer`, `1c-arch-reviewer`) lose their write and shell boundary and end up guarded by prompt text alone. If an installed agent is missing shell or MCP, the installer mapping is what needs re-running.

## Model-tier routing

Subagent source files do **not** hard-code model names. Each agent declares an abstract tier in its frontmatter — `modelTier: coding`, `modelTier: analysis`, or `modelTier: light` — and the installer resolves the tier into a concrete model from `.dev.env` (`SUBAGENT_MODEL_CODING` / `SUBAGENT_MODEL_ANALYSIS` / `SUBAGENT_MODEL_LIGHT`, all Defaulted: empty = the AI client's default model; see `dev-standards-env.md → "Subagent model parameters"`). Model names live only in project settings, never in rules or agent prompts. On first install the installer proposes a benchmark-based profile (`Balanced` / `Economy` / `Quality`, derived from <https://onec-llm-bench.lovable.app/>); the recommendation lives in the installer / `.dev.env`, not here.

The three tiers:

- **`coding`** — code / metadata authorship and design: writing or editing BSL and metadata, architecture design, error fixes. Agents: `1c-developer`, `1c-metadata-manager`, `1c-architect`, `1c-performance-optimizer`, `1c-refactoring`, `1c-error-fixer`, `1c-extension-analyst`. Warrants the strongest model — this tier mutates production code.
- **`analysis`** — reasoning without production-code authorship: planning, analysis, review, testing, documentation. Agents: `1c-planner`, `1c-analytic`, `1c-arch-reviewer`, `1c-code-reviewer`, `1c-doc-writer`, `1c-tester`. A strong-value model is usually enough.
- **`light`** — small bounded read-only tasks where a cheaper / faster model saves limits without hurting quality: repo scouting, search, impact lists, mechanical post-edit checks. Agent: `1c-explorer`. Bounded edits may still be routed down per invocation (below), but no code-writing agent declares this tier.

Routing rules:

- **Good candidates for the `light` tier** (when the active tool supports a per-invocation model override, the parent may route these down even to a `coding`-tier agent): initial project-source scouting and candidate lists; navigation / reference gathering for objects, modules, forms, procedures; impact lists ("where is X used"); mechanical verification after edits; small bounded edits in strictly assigned files.
- **Never use the `light` tier as the final authority** for architecture, metadata / form design, transactions, registers, complex queries, security, data integrity, or release-critical decisions. Output of a light-tier run is working material, not a source of truth — the parent agent owns decomposition, source boundaries, the final decision, verification, and integration.
- **Do not delegate trivial single-step tasks at all** — the launch overhead exceeds the saving.
- The tier system does not change validation obligations: whatever tier produced the change, the applicable validator chain and closing gate from `verification-gates.md` still apply, including quick-fixes.

## Bounded sidecar task templates

When delegating, the launch prompt must make the task **bounded and self-contained**. Every delegation prompt includes:

- **bounded responsibility** — one verifiable goal, not "help with the task";
- **allowed and forbidden sources** — which MCP servers / files to use; the MCP-first search discipline (`mcp-first-search.md`) applies to subagents too;
- **read/write scope** — explicitly read-only, or an explicit list of files the subagent may edit;
- **expected output format** — what the report must contain;
- a reminder that the subagent **is not alone in the codebase**: it must not revert or overwrite changes outside its scope and must not delete files without an explicit instruction.

Reusable templates (fill in `<...>`; they slot into the matching subagent from the catalog):

### explorer-impact — read-only impact analysis (`1c-explorer`, light-tier candidate)

```text
Read-only impact analysis. Find all references to <object / procedure / attribute>.
Follow the project MCP fallback chain (graph metadata → code metadata → grep=true retry → Grep).
Thoroughness: <quick | medium>. Do not edit files.
Return: locations with file/line references and qualified 1C names, usage categories
(call / query / RLS / form / subscription), risky dependencies, and gaps you could not verify.
```

### explorer-patterns — find existing implementations (`1c-explorer`, light-tier candidate)

```text
Read-only pattern search. Find existing implementations similar to <task>.
Prefer templatesearch / ssl_search / search_code over raw grep. Do not edit files.
Return: 3–7 best examples with paths and qualified names, which pattern to reuse, and what NOT to copy.
```

### metadata-scout — inspect an object / form before a change (`1c-explorer`, light-tier candidate)

```text
Read-only metadata/form scout. Inspect <metadata object / form / layout> via get_object_dossier /
get_metadata_details / inspect_form_layout; confirm against the source XML/BSL when in doubt.
Do not edit files. Return: object structure, form elements / commands / events, related modules,
validation risks, and a suggested write scope for the implementation step.
```

### worker-bounded-edit — implementation within fixed boundaries (`1c-developer` / `1c-error-fixer`)

```text
Bounded implementation. You are not alone in the codebase; do not revert or overwrite edits
outside your scope. Edit only: <files>. Implement <specific change> per the approved plan.
Follow project rules (dev-standards-code-style, module-structure). For BSL run syntaxcheck →
check_1c_code → review_1c_code on every touched module within the verification budget;
for metadata XML run verify_xml (and both chains when it embeds BSL).
Return: changed files, diff summary against the plan, checks performed, unresolved risks.
```

### reviewer-risk — independent review (`1c-code-reviewer`, **only when the user explicitly asked for a review**)

```text
Independent review of the current change for bugs, regressions, missing checks, and project-rule
violations. Review scope: <parent-provided git diff and/or explicit file list>. Do not edit files.
The reviewer has no Shell and must not infer an absent scope. High-confidence
findings only, ordered by severity, with file/line references; then test gaps and residual risk.
```

### smoke-check — mechanical post-change verification (`1c-explorer`, light-tier candidate)

```text
Read-only smoke check. Verify that <feature / rule / artifact> is discoverable and consistent through
its intended entry points (referenced paths exist, names match, wiring is complete). Do not edit files.
Return: exact checks performed, observed result, pass/fail per item.
```
