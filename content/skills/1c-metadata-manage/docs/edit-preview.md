# Preview, dry-run and logical addressing — `Invoke-1CEdit.ps1` / `Invoke-1CEdit.py`

Reference for `tools/_common/Invoke-1CEdit.ps1`. The short version lives in [`SKILL.md → Logical addressing and optional preview`](../SKILL.md); read this file for the address grammar, the rollback backends, and what the wrapper deliberately does not promise.

Its Python peer `tools/_common/Invoke-1CEdit.py` carries the same contract for the tools that ship a `.py` runtime; the one difference is described under *Invocation*.

## Why a wrapper and not thirty patches

The tools under `tools/` are vendored from upstream `cc-1c-skills`. Each one opens and writes its own files; there is no shared write layer to patch. Adding a preview flag to every mutating script would mean editing thirty-odd files — including `form-compile.ps1` at 355 KB — and losing all of it at the next upstream sync. The wrapper sits in front of them instead, so preview, dry-run and logical addressing are two local files (`Invoke-1CEdit.ps1` and `MetadataAddress.ps1`) that an upstream refresh never touches.

The trade this makes: the wrapper cannot know what a tool *intends* to write, only what it *did* write. So a preview really runs the tool and then undoes it. Everything below follows from that. That is why preview is **not** a default step of the development cycle.

## When preview runs

`METADATA_PREVIEW` in `.dev.env` (`dev-standards-env.md → Process-tuning parameters`) is **Defaulted** — empty / invalid = `auto`. The agent never asks for the value; the editor is `/previewmode`.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `auto` (default / empty) | Preview only when the shape of the write cannot be predicted from the call: **generation from a DSL** — `form-compile`, `meta-compile`, `role-compile`, an `skd-edit` batch — and **a tool or `-Operation` this project has not run before** (one preview, then proceed normally). Every other write applies immediately: a single attribute, a synonym, a flag, one form field — the post-apply diff already answers "what changed". |
| `on` | Preview before every wrapper-driven write. |
| `off` | Only on an explicit request (`/previewmode once`, «покажи, что изменится»). |

The policy is the same for both wrappers: on Linux / macOS the preview is `Invoke-1CEdit.py -Preview`, for the tools it wraps (see *Invocation*).

One boundary in every mode, `on` included: the wrapper previews **its own script writes only**. Edits made with the host's file tools (Cursor apply / reject, Claude Code rewrite — that UI is the review) and BSL proposals from `rewrite_1c_code` / `modify_1c_code` never pass through it. When the git backend refuses a dirty tree, apply and say so in one line — never stash or commit the user's work to force a preview, and never fork a host-specific dry-run.

Deletions keep their own gate regardless of the mode: native `-DryRun` then `-Force` on `remove-form`, `meta-remove`, `remove-template`, `web-unpublish` — a plan the tool itself prints without writing. A preview is never a verification gate: `meta-validate`, `verify_xml` and `syntaxcheck` run exactly as before, and the cycle — triage → [repository `lock`] → mutate → verify → [repository `commit`] → report — is unchanged; the preview is an extra mutate-and-undo inside the mutate step. Never hold repository locks across a write-then-rollback pause.

## Invocation

```powershell
Invoke-1CEdit.ps1 -Tool <name> [-Object <address>] [-Root <dump>] [-Preview] [-Scope <paths>] [-NoDiff] <tool parameters…>
```

```bash
python3 tools/_common/Invoke-1CEdit.py -Tool <name> [-Object <address>] [-Root <dump>] [-Preview] [-Scope <paths>] [-NoDiff] <tool parameters…>
```

The table below applies to both runtimes. One difference: the PowerShell wrapper resolves `-Tool` among the `.ps1` scripts and wraps any tool of this skill; the Python wrapper resolves among the `.py` entry points and wraps only the tools that ship one — a PowerShell-only tool is refused with that explanation, because a wrapper that cannot vouch for a tool's contract must not pretend to guard it.

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-Tool` | Script base name — `meta-edit`, `form-edit`, `skd-edit`, `role-compile`, … Resolved by file name under `tools/`, so a tool added by a later sync works with no edit here. An ambiguous name is an error, never a guess. |
| `-Object` | Logical address (grammar below). Resolved and passed as `-Path`, the alias every path-taking tool of this skill carries. Omit it for tools addressed differently (`meta-remove -ConfigDir -Object`, the `db-*` family) and pass their own parameters. |
| `-Root` | Dump root. Default: `EXPORT_PATH` from `.dev.env`, else the nearest ancestor holding `Configuration.xml`. |
| `-Preview` / `-DryRun` | Run, show the diff, restore the tree. |
| `-Scope` | Extra paths to watch and restore. Only meaningful for the copy backend. |
| `-NoDiff` | Apply without printing the diff. |
| everything else | Passed through to the tool by name. |

Exit code is the tool's own, with one exception: a preview whose rollback did not fully succeed exits `2` and says what is still on disk. Treat `2` as "inspect the tree before doing anything else".

## Address grammar

```
<Kind>.<Name>                        -> Catalogs\Контрагенты.xml
<Kind>.<Name>.Форма.<FormName>       -> …\Forms\<FormName>\Ext\Form.xml
<Kind>.<Name>.Макет.<TemplateName>   -> …\Templates\<TemplateName>\Ext\Template.xml
<Kind>.<Name>.Права                  -> …\Ext\Rights.xml
<Kind>.<Name>.МодульОбъекта          -> …\Ext\ObjectModule.bsl
<Kind>.<Name>.МодульМенеджера        -> …\Ext\ManagerModule.bsl
<Kind>.<Name>.МодульНабораЗаписей    -> …\Ext\RecordSetModule.bsl
```

Kind names and member keywords are accepted in Russian and English (`Справочник` or `Catalog`, `Форма` or `Form`). The full kind table is `tools/_common/MetadataAddress.ps1` / `MetadataAddress.py`; an unknown kind is refused with the accepted list, because a mistyped kind silently resolving to a non-existent path is exactly the failure this removes.

`Роль.ПолныеПрава.Права` is the useful one for `role-info` / `role-validate`: they take `Ext\Rights.xml`, which nobody remembers.

## Rollback backends

The backend is chosen automatically and always named in the output.

**git** — the dump is inside a repository. The whole dump is watched, so a write outside the edited object is caught too. Rollback is `git checkout` plus `git clean` of the watched path.

> The run **refuses to start** (exit `2`) when the watched path already has uncommitted changes. Rolling back over someone's work in progress is the one failure this must never cause. Commit or stash first, or apply without `-Preview`.

**copy** — no repository. The target file, the object's own folder and the root `Configuration.xml` are copied to a temp folder before the run. The watched scope is printed, and additions, modifications and deletions inside it are diffed and restored. A write **outside** that scope is neither shown nor undone; the output says so rather than implying full coverage. Use `-Scope` when a tool is known to reach further.

## What this does not do

- It is **not** a plan produced before execution. The tool runs for real; a preview differs from an apply only in what happens afterwards. Do not preview against a production dump under the assumption that nothing is written — something is written, then reverted.
- It does **not** replace validation. `meta-edit` still runs `meta-validate` and still exits non-zero on a bad object; the preview shows the diff *and* the validator verdict, and both belong in the report.
- It does **not** cover the `db-*` infobase family in any useful way. Those talk to an infobase, not to files, and an infobase change is not restored by putting files back. Preview them with their own switches where they have them (`db-load-git -DryRun`) and treat the rest as the destructive operations they are.
- `Invoke-1CEdit.py` (the Linux / macOS wrapper) wraps only the tools that ship a `.py` runtime — that is whose parameter contract it can introspect and vouch for. A PowerShell-only tool (`web-info` / `web-stop` / `web-unpublish`, the `cfe-patch-method` resync modes, the `_shared` helpers) is refused with that explanation; on Windows `Invoke-1CEdit.ps1` still wraps it. For a wrapped Python tool whose own `-DryRun` does not exist the rollback is real, exactly as for the PowerShell wrapper.

## Reporting

Name a preview on the existing `Metadata tooling:` line only when one actually ran:

```
Metadata tooling: Invoke-1CEdit -Tool meta-edit -Object Справочник.Контрагенты (preview shown, then applied)
```

An immediate apply cites the tool without a preview clause.
