# 1c-metadata-manage — sync history of the vendored scripts

The PowerShell tools under `tools/` are vendored from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills) (MIT). This file holds the per-document sync notes that used to close each `docs/*.md` (what each upstream sync changed, what was cross-checked and what stays deliberately local). It is maintainer history — nothing loads it during a task; the operational description of every tool lives in the domain doc named by each heading.

## bsp-manage.md

### Upstream sync `2026-07-30`

Re-checked against upstream `epf-bsp-init` / `epf-bsp-add-command` at the `2026-07-30` sync: **no drift** — kinds, default command types, the `СведенияОВнешнейОбработке` skeleton, `Назначение` / `Модификатор` sections, `НСтр` literals for additional commands, and every handler template (`ВыполнитьКоманду` branches, `Печать` with `УправлениеПечатью.СведенияОПечатнойФорме`) still match Sections 1–2 below. Nothing to port; both skills remain no-script upstream.

### Earlier Additions (upstream `w-2026-05-17`)

The upstream `cc-1c-skills` skills `epf-bsp-init` and `epf-bsp-add-command` are no-script (the agent does the work directly via Read / Edit / Glob / Grep). Their content is already covered by Sections 1–2 of this document, in English. Cross-checked against upstream `w-2026-05-17`:

- Kind mapping (six kinds: `ДополнительнаяОбработка`, `ДополнительныйОтчет`, `ЗаполнениеОбъекта`, `Отчет`, `ПечатнаяФорма`, `СозданиеСвязанныхОбъектов`) — aligned.
- Default command type per kind — aligned.
- Free-form command types (open form, client method, server method, form filling, safe-mode script) — aligned.
- `СведенияОВнешнейОбработке` skeleton, `Назначение` section for assignable kinds, `Модификатор` for `ПечатнаяФорма` — aligned.
- Server handlers (`ВыполнитьКоманду` for `ЗаполнениеОбъекта` / `СозданиеСвязанныхОбъектов` / global processors, `Печать` for `ПечатнаяФорма`) — aligned.

No script files were brought into `tools/` — the operations are pure module-text edits performed by the agent, which is how upstream ships them as well.

## cf-manage.md

### Upstream sync `2026-07-30`

Scripts refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills): `cf-edit` v1.4 → **v1.11**, `cf-info` v1.2 → **v1.4**, `cf-init` v1.2 → **v1.3**, `cf-validate` v1.3 → **v1.4**.

- **`cf-edit` now enforces the vendor support gate** — it refuses to edit a configuration whose "possibility of modification" is off, and points at `support-edit`. See [support-manage.md](support-manage.md).
- **`cf-info` reports the support state** of the configuration (read from `Ext/ParentConfigurations.bin`) — whether it is on vendor support and whether modification is allowed.

### Earlier Additions (upstream `w-2026-05-17`)

The PowerShell scripts under `tools/1c-cf-manage/scripts/` were refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills). Highlights:

#### `cf-init`

- Generates a default panel layout aligned with stock ERP/БП ≥ 8.3.24: open windows on top, sections on the left. Without this layout the web client renders sections as icons only — `web-test` could not see them. Modern interface mode + 8.2-style backward compatibility is the default.

#### `cf-edit` — new operations

- **`set-panels`** — configure the configuration panels via JSON. Aliases by name (`sections`, `open`, `favorites`, `history`, `functions`), panel stacking via `{group: [...]}`, multiple panels side-by-side. Russian aliases (`Открытых`, `Разделов`, `Избранного`, `История`, `Функций`) are accepted and silently mapped to canonical English aliases.
- **`set-home-page`** — rewrite the home page: one or two columns, list of forms with height / visibility / role overrides.
- **`add-childObject`** — now requires the object file to exist on disk; otherwise the script fails with a hint to call `/meta-compile`, `/role-compile`, `/subsystem-compile` first. Previously `Configuration.xml` could end up referencing a missing file and the platform would silently refuse to load. The legacy mode (root XML lost while files survive) is preserved for the rare rollback scenario.

#### `cf-info`

- Configuration overview shows the panel layout (panel stacks within one side and side-by-side panels). With `-Section home-page` — full home page contents with layout and role overrides.

#### `cf-validate`

- Cross-references `Form` references in the home page and in default-form properties of configuration objects — broken links are now caught at validation time, not at load time.
- Platform 8.5 support — new compatibility-mode and interface-mode values plus the new XML header format. (Same upgrade in `cfe-validate`, `epf-validate`, `skd-validate`.)

## cfe-manage.md

### Recent Additions (upstream sync `2026-07-30`)

The PowerShell scripts under `tools/1c-cfe-manage/scripts/` were refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills). Highlights of this sync (previous base: late May 2026):

#### `cfe-patch-method` — v1.1 → v2.5, the biggest change in this group

- **Source-aware generation**: the original method is read from the source configuration (`-ConfigPath`, auto-detectable via `.dev.env` `EXPORT_PATH`), so the interceptor gets the real signature, context directive and — for `ModificationAndControl` — the full original body. `ModulePath` may now be a path to the source `.bsl` instead of a logical name.
- **`Instead` (`&Вместо`)** interceptor type with a `ПродолжитьВызов(...)` scaffold; works for functions too.
- **Drift control** — `-Check` / `-Actualize` over controlled (`&ИзменениеИКонтроль`) methods, extension-wide or narrowed to a module / method. Re-applies your `#Вставка` / `#Удаление` edits onto a changed vendor original, reports what moved, what conflicted and what the vendor has already adopted. Conflicts land in a merge workspace with anchored `conflict.md` files instead of being lost. **Run `-Check` after every vendor update** — the platform never reports this drift itself.
- Repeated interception of an already patched method is skipped instead of duplicated.

Full description in section 4 above.

#### `cfe-borrow` — borrowing forms now matches Configurator output

- The borrowed form gets the **complete `ChildItems` tree** (not the previously empty skeleton). Loadable into the target base without manual XML fixes for complex ERP forms.
- **Dependencies are auto-borrowed**: shared pictures, style elements, enums, and enum values used by the borrowed form. No more cascade of "object not found" errors after the first load.
- `DataPath`, `Events`, `TitleDataPath`, `TypeLink`, `CommandName` are stripped from the borrowed form (these caused "invalid data path" / "event not loaded" errors on real ERP forms, also for command-bar buttons).
- Form-level properties (`AutoTitle`, `WindowOpeningMode`, …) are preserved both in the main section and in `BaseForm`.
- **`-BorrowMainAttribute`** (`Form` or `All`) — borrows the form's main attribute (`Object`) and transitively all its attributes, tabular sections, and dependent types. Closes the manual-collection workflow when adding an attribute to a borrowed form.

#### `cfe-validate`

- New checks for borrowed-form structure, their dependencies (shared pictures, style elements, enums), and the extension's own subobjects (attributes, tabular sections, enum values, forms).
- False positives removed: `DataPath` / `TitleDataPath` inside `BaseForm` are correct (Configurator emits them); the extension's own subobjects (own attributes, own enum values) are no longer validated as borrowed.

#### `cfe-init`

- Interface mode and compatibility mode are inherited from the base configuration (resolved via `-ConfigPath`). The extension matches the base's behaviour by default.

#### Vendor support

An extension is the **default answer** when a typical object on vendor support needs a change: support state stays untouched and vendor updates keep flowing. The mutating tools of this skill now enforce that — they refuse to edit a locked object directly and point here. See [support-manage.md](support-manage.md).

## db-manage.md

### Recent Additions (upstream sync `2026-07-30`)

The PowerShell scripts under `tools/1c-db-ops/scripts/` were refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills). Highlights of this sync (previous base: late May 2026):

- **`db-dump-dt` / `db-load-dt`** — new: full infobase snapshot (configuration + data). See sections 9 and 10.
- **All `db-*` / `epf-*`** — `-AdditionalV8Arguments` / `-AdditionalIbcmdArguments` with per-engine validation and secret masking (see *Common Parameters*); project-wide defaults via `v8args` / `ibcmdargs` in `.v8-project.json`.
- **Platform resolution** — unified across the scripts: explicit `-V8Path` → project config → auto-detect the newest `C:\Program Files\1cv8\*\bin\1cv8.exe`. Locally patched so the project config is read from **`.dev.env`** (`PLATFORM_PATH`, `PLATFORM_ARGS`, `IBCMD_ARGS`, `SUPPORT_GUARD`) before upstream's `.v8-project.json`, and so a **version install directory** — the shape `PLATFORM_PATH` uses — resolves via `bin\1cv8.exe`.
- **`db-load-xml`** — strict log parsing. Catches "Неверное свойство объекта метаданных", "Неизвестное имя типа" and similar messages that the platform writes to the log despite a formal "success" exit. Previously a partial silent metadata loss was reported as a green run.
- **`db-load-xml` / `db-load-git`** — `-UpdateDB` flag combines load + database update in a single Configurator launch (was two separate calls).
- **`db-load-git`** — picks up changes to HTML help (`ru.html` and similar) via partial load even without the accompanying `Help.xml` in the commit. Previously such edits were silently dropped and the help text in the base stayed stale. Fixed search for changed files when sources live in a nested folder of the repo (`src/cf` etc.); path normalisation for the configuration directory is corrected.
- **db-list** — already fully described in Part 1 of this doc (registry of `.v8-project.json`). It is a no-script skill in upstream — the agent reads / writes the JSON directly. No script files were added under `tools/`.

## edit-preview.md

### Python wrapper for the ported tools (`2026-09-09`)

`Invoke-1CEdit.ps1` and `MetadataAddress.ps1` arrived with an upstream sync as PowerShell-only helpers, which left a Linux / macOS install without logical addressing, unified diff and preview — while `AGENTS.md` required the preview unconditionally. Both helpers now ship Python peers (`Invoke-1CEdit.py`, `MetadataAddress.py`, stdlib only — the runtime requirement of the ports does not grow). Same contract, one deliberate difference: the Python wrapper wraps only the tools that carry a `.py` runtime — it introspects their `argparse` declarations through the `ast` module instead of the PowerShell param-block parser (importing a port would execute it, so the AST is the only safe reader) — and refuses a PowerShell-only tool with that explanation. The rollback backends are unchanged: `git checkout` / `git clean` over a verified-clean watched path, the copy snapshot otherwise; the diff is `git diff --no-index` in both runtimes. Pinned by `tools/tests/python-ports-regression.py`.

## epf-manage.md

### Upstream sync `2026-07-30`

Scripts refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills): `epf-build` v1.0 → **v1.12**, `epf-dump` v1.0 → **v1.11**, `stub-db-create` v1.0 → **v1.7**, `erf-init` → **v1.1** (full ERF scaffold — the local copy was a truncated variant).

- **Build / dump via `ibcmd`** — full EPF *and* ERF assembly and disassembly without launching the Designer, when the platform path points at `ibcmd`.
- **`-AdditionalV8Arguments` / `-AdditionalIbcmdArguments`** with per-engine validation and secret masking — same contract as the `db-*` tools ([db-manage.md](db-manage.md)).
- Platform resolution unified with the `db-*` tools (explicit path → `.dev.env` → `.v8-project.json` → auto-detect), locally patched to accept the version install directory shape used by `.dev.env` `PLATFORM_PATH`.
- Autonomous external objects (EPF/ERF) are explicitly exempt from the vendor support gate — they are never part of a configuration on support.

### Earlier Additions (upstream `w-2026-05-17`)

The PowerShell script `tools/1c-epf-validate/scripts/epf-validate.ps1` was refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills). Highlights:

- **Format version auto-detection** from the nearest `Configuration.xml` (8.3.27+, 8.5).
- **Platform 8.5** support across `epf-validate` and `erf-validate` (new compatibility-mode and interface-mode values, new XML header format).
- **Universal validator improvements** — one-liner output by default (`-Detailed` for the full per-check trace); accepts both an XML file and a folder path as the primary argument; universal `-Path` parameter alongside legacy `-ObjectPath`.
- The same script handles `erf-validate` — upstream `erf-validate` is a thin pass-through to `epf-validate.ps1`, the script auto-detects `ExternalReport` vs `ExternalDataProcessor` from the root XML element. No separate `erf-validate.ps1` is shipped.

## form-manage.md

### Local fix `2026-09-14` — compact XML across the reported writers

`form-edit.ps1` normalizes empty tags to Configurator's `<Tag/>` spelling and retains the input EOL. The same save-time behavior covers `form-add`, `remove-form`, parent registration by `form-compile`, `cf-edit`, object registration/merge by `cfe-borrow`, `subsystem-edit`, parent registration by `subsystem-compile`, `interface-edit`, `add-template` and `add-help`. `skd-edit` already normalized tags; its normalization now protects CDATA, comments and processing instructions. No shared runtime dependency was added.

Focused regressions exercise each reported writer on temporary fixtures. Command-add checks compare unrelated form text byte-for-byte for LF and CRLF; template checks cover absolute/relative XML paths and the existing name/EPF lookup. The remove-form quarantine and rollback remain intact.

### Python runtime for `form-remove` (`2026-09-04`)

`remove-form.py` is vendored from the same upstream repository, pinned at commit `ecd289fe11733028d87b55284ea9fb5feff8f513` — the state the PowerShell family below was synced from, so both runtimes are the same tool generation. It exists so a Linux / macOS install is not left with a script it cannot run.

The upstream port needed the same local hardening the PowerShell script carries, and one ordering fix on top: upstream rejects `-DryRun` as an unknown argument, deletes without `-Force`, and deletes the form files **before** parsing the root XML, so a parse failure leaves a half-removed tree. The vendored copy follows the shipped contract instead — parse → plan → gate → atomic root-XML write → delete. Both runtimes are pinned against each other by `tools/tests/python-ports-regression.py`.

The safety hardening is applied to **both** runtimes, so a Windows user is not left with the weaker tool: identifier validation, path containment and the transactional mutation path live in `remove-form.ps1` as well.

The Python port keeps upstream's round-trip style preservation (BOM, EOL, `encoding` case, `<Tag/>`). Since the local 2026-09-14 fix, `remove-form.ps1` also keeps the input EOL and compact empty tags when it stages the parent XML; the quarantine and rollback sequence is unchanged. The `ChildObjects` indentation is identical in both.

Licence: the vendored upstream code is MIT; the full notice ships with the skill as [`NOTICE.md`](../NOTICE.md) and is installed alongside it.

### Upstream sync `2026-07-30`

Scripts refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills): `form-compile` v1.23 → **v1.175**, `form-add` v1.5 → **v1.11**, `form-edit` v1.0 → **v1.5**, `form-info` v1.3 → **v1.5**, `form-validate` v1.6 → **v1.8**, `form-remove` → **v1.4**.

- **`form-compile` is the big one** — 150+ upstream releases since the previous base. The DSL grew well past what [form-compile-dsl.md](form-compile-dsl.md) describes: dynamic-list settings (filters, order, conditional appearance, groupings, calculated fields, typed parameter values), forgiving platform types (`StandardPeriod`, `StandardBeginningDate`, `UUID`), roles by GUID for borrowed / extension forms, `SettingsStorage`. **The complete grammar is vendored as [`form-dsl-spec.md`](../tools/1c-form-compile/form-dsl-spec.md)** — read it when a key is missing from the local reference.
- **Support gate** — `form-compile`, `form-edit`, `form-add` refuse to touch a form of a locked object of a typical configuration. See [support-manage.md](support-manage.md).
- **`form-add`** — `DocumentJournal` support.
- **`form-validate`** — dangling-binding checks; paired with the `cfe-borrow` re-borrow idempotency fix.
- **`form-info`** — prints the object's support state.
- **`form-remove`** — clears **every** `Default*Form` slot pointing at the removed form (previously only the generic `DefaultForm`, which left a dangling reference to a deleted form). Local `-DryRun` / `-Force` safety gate is preserved on top.

### Earlier Additions (upstream `w-2026-05-17`)

In addition to the form-compile / form-info / form-add / form-edit / form-remove changes already documented in sections 2–5, **`form-validate`** got the following improvements (script `tools/1c-form-validate/scripts/form-validate.ps1`):

- Stops false-flagging real ERP and БП forms — `Items.<Table>.CurrentData.<Field>` and `~<DynamicList>.<Field>` paths are now correctly resolved through the table's data attribute. Missing table → error; third segment ≠ `CurrentData` → warning.
- Opaque platform paths (`"10"`, `"1000003"`, `"N/M: "`) are skipped without an error. Previously Check 5 reported "attribute not found" on these.
- New attribute-type check in `data`: error on intentionally invalid types, warning on unrecognised ones. Context is honoured — `ExternalDataProcessorObject` / `ExternalReportObject` are valid only inside an external data processor / report; in regular configuration object forms it is an error with a hint to use the inner object type.
- Platform 8.5 support — new compatibility / interface mode values and the new XML header format.
- Brief output by default; full per-check trace via `-Detailed`. The `-Path` parameter accepts both a `Form.xml` file and a `Forms/<Name>` folder (auto-resolves to `Forms/<Name>/Ext/Form.xml`).

### What's New in `form-compile` (vs the previous local snapshot)

- **`-FromObject` mode** — produces a typical form from object metadata; purpose (`Object`/`List`/`Choice`/`Folder`/`Record`) is inferred from `OutputPath`. Document list forms get the standard `Number` and `Date` columns automatically; ChartOfAccounts pulls accounting flags / sub-account kinds correctly.
- **New element types** — `radio` (RadioButtonField with `radioButtonType`: `Auto` / `RadioButtons` / `Tumbler`, `choiceList`); `autoCmdBar` (fills the form's main AutoCommandBar id=-1); `columnGroup` (column grouping inside table `columns` — `horizontal` / `vertical` / `inCell`, nestable).
- **New input keys** — `textEdit: false` (disable free text editing on reference fields), `maxWidth` / `maxHeight` (hard caps, usually with `autoMaxWidth: false`).
- **New group key** — `collapsed: true` for `"group": "collapsible"` (group starts collapsed).
- **Multilingual strings** — any title / presentation may be `{ "ru": "...", "en": "..." }`.
- **Auto-titles** — attributes, commands, pages, popups and decorations without explicit `title` get a humanised title from the name (`НомерСчёта` → "Номер счёта").
- **Format version** — auto-detected from the nearest `Configuration.xml` (8.3.27+, 8.5).
- **Presets** — `tools/1c-form-compile/presets/erp-standard.json` is shipped; project-level override at `<projectRoot>/presets/skills/form/<name>.json`.
- **Defaults aligned with real ERP/БП forms** — multi-line inputs are not auto-width-bounded by default; checkbox title is on the right; `autoTitle` is suppressed when `title` is set; objects with editable state save the input state (`Esc → confirm`).

## help-manage.md

### Upstream sync `2026-07-30`

Script refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills): `help-add` v1.4 → **v1.9**. It now enforces the vendor support gate — adding help to a locked object of a typical configuration is refused with a pointer to `support-edit` ([support-manage.md](support-manage.md)).

## interface-manage.md

### Upstream sync `2026-07-30`

Scripts refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills): `interface-edit` v1.3 → **v1.8**, `interface-validate` → **v1.1**. `interface-edit` now enforces the vendor support gate — it refuses to edit the command interface of a locked typical configuration ([support-manage.md](support-manage.md)).

### Earlier Additions (upstream `w-2026-05-17`)

The PowerShell scripts under `tools/1c-interface-manage/scripts/` were refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills). Highlights:

- **`interface-edit`** — operations `place` / `order` accept the value as an object (not only as a string). Command names in `hide` / `show` / `place` / `order` are normalised: `Catalogs.X` and `Справочник.X` map to canonical `Catalog.X`.
- **`interface-validate`** — universal validator improvements (one-liner output by default, `-Detailed`, folder path auto-resolution) — see `role-manage.md` → "Recent Additions".

## meta-manage.md

### Local fix `2026-09-13` — refuse false-success template additions

Both `meta-edit` runtimes refuse `add-template` before any write, including aliases and mixed JSON. The error points to the existing PowerShell template scaffold and requires an explicit template type. No partial registration is presented as a completed template.

### Python port of `meta-compile` caught up with v1.69 (`2026-09-09`)

`meta-compile.py` (v1.68) trailed `meta-compile.ps1` (v1.69) by the upstream `4aef5ca` release: `NEW_OBJECT_POSITION` was silently ignored and the registration rewrote `Configuration.xml` through `ElementTree`, restyling the whole file. The port now mirrors the PowerShell section 17 one to one — `.dev.env` is the source of truth with the `.v8-project.json` fallback (databases with a covering `configSrc`, then the root field), `byName` sorts inside the kind group by the Configurator-tree key pairs (АПК:1108), order-sensitive kinds (`Subsystem`, `CommandGroup`, `CommonAttribute`, `Language`) are never reordered, a brand-new kind group lands in canonical type order, and the registration is a raw-text insertion: the file is kept byte-for-byte except the single added line. Pinned by `tools/tests/python-ports-regression.py` (six cases against the shared `config-dump` fixture).

### Upstream sync `2026-07-30`

Scripts refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills): `meta-compile` v1.12 → **v1.68**, `meta-edit` v1.6 → **v1.23**, `meta-validate` v1.3 → **v1.12**, `meta-info` v1.2 → **v1.4**, `meta-remove` v1.1 → **v1.5**.

- **Support gate** — `meta-edit` / `meta-compile` refuse to touch an object of a typical configuration that is locked ("на замке"); `meta-remove` refuses to delete an object still on support. See [support-manage.md](support-manage.md).
- **`meta-compile`** — many more object types authorable from the DSL (`CommonPicture`, `CommonTemplate`, `SessionParameter`, `CommonCommand`, `CommandGroup`, `CommonAttribute`, `FunctionalOptionsParameter`, `WSReference`), format 2.20 properties (platform 8.3.27), command-group validation, better auto-synonym derivation. Full grammar: [`meta-dsl-spec.md`](../tools/1c-meta-compile/meta-dsl-spec.md).
- **`meta-edit`** — structural attribute properties are now editable point-wise: `Format` / `EditFormat` / `ToolTip` / `ChoiceForm`, `MinValue` / `MaxValue`, `LinkByType` / `ChoiceParameterLinks`, `ChoiceParameters`, `FillValue`; list properties `DataLockFields` / `RegisteredDocuments`; `add-predefined` for predefined items; create-if-missing for properties with a type guard.
- **`meta-validate`** — checks that referenced types exist, validates object commands (group + parameter rule), version-dependent properties and the `LineNumberLength` range, `MDObjectRef` reference shape, and rejects reserved attribute names in a type-aware way.
- **`meta-info`** — prints the object's support state and the type presentation for reference objects.

### Earlier Additions (upstream `w-2026-05-17`)

The PowerShell scripts under `tools/1c-meta-{compile,edit,info,remove,validate}/scripts/` were refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills). Highlights:

#### `meta-compile` — new properties and stricter type rules

- **Catalog properties** are now driven by JSON (no more hard-coded values): `limitLevelCount`, `levelCount`, `foldersOnTop`, `subordinationUse`, `codeSeries`, `quickChoice`, `choiceMode`. Hand-edit of XML is no longer required for non-default settings.
- **`owners`** — array of catalog owners with shorthand syntax.
- **`multiLine: true`** (or flag `| multiline`) on an attribute marks it as multiline.
- **`choiceHistoryOnInput`** on attributes — controls history-based auto-completion when entering a reference value.
- **Default for `quickChoice`** aligned with real configurations: catalogs / chart-of-characteristic-types / chart-of-accounts / chart-of-calculation-types / exchange plans default to `false`; enums default to `true` (≈95% / ≈99% match across real configs).
- **Manager modules** are now created alongside the object module for **reports and data processors** — required for reports that override `НастроитьВариантыОтчета`. Constants get manager and value-manager modules; enums get a manager module.
- **Empty `Ext/` folders** no longer created for constants, enums and document journals — they previously caused the platform to wipe extension modules on load.
- **Register-attribute properties** are filtered by register kind: AccumulationRegister / AccountingRegister / CalculationRegister attributes no longer get attribute-only properties the platform silently dropped. InformationRegister keeps the full set.
- **System enum values** in properties (`RegisterType`, `WriteMode`, `Periodicity`, …≈20 more) now accept synonyms and are case-insensitive — typical model errors like `Balances` → `Balance` or Russian variants no longer break the build.
- **Strict validation of enum values**: an unknown value for a known property gives a clear error instead of leaking into XML.
- **Format version** auto-detected from the nearest `Configuration.xml` (8.3.27+, 8.5).

#### `meta-edit`

- Same synonym dictionary and case-insensitivity for system enum values, applied in `modify-attribute` / `modify-property` and when parsing `fillChecking` / `indexing`.

#### `meta-validate`

- Empty register check (no dimensions, no resources, no attributes — platform refuses to load).
- Document-movements pointing to a non-existent register are reported.

#### `meta-remove`

- Returns exit code 1 when the object is not found (was silently 0).

### Upstream sync `2026-07-30`

Scripts refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills): `mxl-compile` v1.1 → **v1.4**, `mxl-info` v1.0 → **v1.2**; `mxl-decompile` / `mxl-validate` unchanged. `mxl-compile` enforces the vendor support gate ([support-manage.md](support-manage.md)); `mxl-info` prints the support state of the layout's owner.

### Earlier Additions (upstream `w-2026-05-17`)

The PowerShell script `tools/1c-mxl-validate/scripts/mxl-validate.ps1` was refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills). Highlights:

- **Universal validator improvements** — one-liner output by default (`-Detailed` for the full per-check trace); accepts both `Template.xml` and a folder path; universal `-Path` parameter alongside legacy `-TemplatePath`.

The compile/decompile/info scripts (`mxl-compile`, `mxl-decompile`, `mxl-info`) were not refreshed — no significant upstream changes for them in this period.

The PowerShell scripts under `tools/1c-role-{compile,info,validate}/scripts/` were refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills). Highlights:

- **`role-compile`** — `OutputDir` now accepts the source root of the configuration; `Roles/` is created automatically. Legacy behaviour (path already ending in `Roles`) is preserved. The DSL key `rights` is accepted as a synonym of `objects`.
- **`role-validate`** — auto-discovers metadata from the path to `Rights.xml`; `-MetadataPath` is no longer required, metadata-driven checks always run when the file is present.
- **All 10 validators** (`role-validate`, `meta-validate`, `epf-validate`, `skd-validate`, `cf-validate`, `cfe-validate`, `form-validate`, `mxl-validate`, `subsystem-validate`, `interface-validate`) now emit a single one-liner by default; the full per-check trace is available via `-Detailed`. Each accepts a folder path as the primary file argument and resolves to the canonical XML file (e.g. `Roles/MyRole` → `Roles/MyRole/Ext/Rights.xml`). The universal `-Path` parameter is supported in addition to the legacy named parameters (`-RolePath`, `-FormPath`, `-TemplatePath`, `-ObjectPath`, …).

## skd-manage.md

### Upstream sync `2026-07-30`

Scripts refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills): `skd-compile` v1.104 → **v1.109**, `skd-edit` v1.24 → **v1.30**, `skd-info` v1.5 → **v1.8**, `skd-decompile` v0.90 → **v0.91**, `skd-validate` → **v1.2**.

- **Support gate** — `skd-compile` / `skd-edit` refuse to modify a schema of a locked typical configuration ([support-manage.md](support-manage.md)).
- **`skd-edit`** — parameter value lists in shorthand (paired with `skd-compile`).
- **`skd-info`** — `-Raw` flag for lossless round-trip extraction of the query text; prints the support state.
- Full DSL grammar vendored as [`skd-dsl-spec.md`](../tools/1c-skd-compile/skd-dsl-spec.md).

### Earlier Additions (upstream sync `w-2026-05-31`)

The PowerShell scripts under `tools/1c-skd-{compile,edit,info,validate}/scripts/` were refreshed again from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills) (`skd-compile` → v1.107, `skd-edit` → v1.28, `skd-info` → v1.7, `skd-validate` → v1.2), and the new `1c-skd-decompile` tool (draft, v0.90 — see section 5) was added. `skd-compile` and `skd-edit` now go through the project's `tools/_shared/support-guard.ps1` before writing (see `support-manage.md`); `skd-info` appends a `"Поддержка: ..."` status line. Highlights from the prior `w-2026-05-17` batch still apply:

#### `skd-edit` — new operations and flags

- `set-field-role` — replace a field role in one line with flag tokens (`@balance`, `@dimension`, `@account`, `@period`, `@required`, `@autoOrder`, `@ignoreNullValues`) and kv params (`balanceGroupName`, `balanceType`, `accountTypeExpression`, …). Closes the "temporarily disable role to debug" pattern.
- `modify-structure` — change groupings by name while preserving selection, order, filters, and conditional appearance.
- `clear-conditionalAppearance` — drop conditional appearance for a field.
- `add-drilldown` — wire detail processing to DCS resources across all named templates.
- `rename-parameter` — atomically rename a parameter and update `&Name` references in other parameters and in all variants.
- `reorder-parameters` — partial list (named ones go first in the given order, the rest keep relative order).
- `modify-parameter` — `use`, `denyIncompleteValues`, `availableValues` (single shot replaces the full list).
- `patch-query` `@once` flag — fail when the substring is missing or appears more than once. Multiline replacements are now correct; empty replacement (`old =>`) deletes the substring.
- `add-total` shortcut: `Func`, `Func(expr)`, or just a field name (non-aggregate functions become an identity expression).
- `set-structure`: comma in shorthand for several fields on one level; quotes in `@name=` are stripped on write; reference parameter types serialise with the right `xsi:type`; batch with `;;` is trimmed.
- `add-selection` accepts `@group=Name` and nested `Folder(...)`.
- `modify-filter` / `modify-dataParameter` preserve `Use=false` when the `@off` / `@on` flag is omitted (no longer silently flipped).
- `conditionalAppearance` — `OrGroup`, `DesignTimeValue`, `Format`. `#noFilter` / `#noOrder` / `#noGroup` flags now also work in `add-calculated-field`.

#### `skd-compile` — DSL upgrades

- `@autoDates` emits the canonical БСП pattern (`НачалоПериода` / `КонецПериода`, two date pickers, `useRestriction`). Shortcut requires the period filled (`use=Always` + `denyIncompleteValues=true`).
- Composite reference types: `"type": ["CatalogRef.A", "CatalogRef.B"]`.
- Multilingual titles / presentations: `{ "ru": "...", "en": "..." }`.
- Horizontal cell merge in templates via `>` (mirror of `|` for vertical) — two-level headers without hand-editing XML.
- Parameters: shorthand `[Title]`, array `availableValues`, `denyIncompleteValues`, flag `@hidden` (auto-`useRestriction`), `@valueList` / `valueListAllowed`, `dataParameters: "auto"` (preserves defaults across all parameter kinds).
- Templates: `drilldown` via `DetailsAreaTemplateParameter`, `groupHeaderTemplate`, `groupName`.
- Structure: `"GroupName[Field] > details"` for named groupings; object form `{ "items": [...] }`; `useRestriction` as an object `{ field: true }`.
- Reference values (chart of accounts, catalog, enum, document) in filters and conditional appearance auto-receive predefined presentations. `Format` parameter as multilingual string. `OrGroup` in conditional appearance via `or`.
- `Folder(Title: f1, f2)` in selection — for `SelectedItemFolder` with nested fields.
- Standard period parameter always serialised in canonical form — no diff after first re-save in Configurator.
- External SQL files via `"@path/to/file.sql"`.
- Compact area templates DSL: `rows`, `widths`, `style` with built-in presets (`header` / `data` / `subheader` / `total`), vertical merging, parameters in cells.
- Project-level user style preset at `<projectRoot>/presets/skills/skd/skd-styles.json` (auto-discovered by `skd-compile`).
- `dataSetLinks` accepts both DSL keys (`sourceExpr`, `destExpr`, `source`, `dest`) and XML keys (`sourceExpression`, `destinationExpression`, ...).
- `--from-object`-like discovery: pass a path to a report or processor folder to `skd-info`, the script finds the embedded DCS template by itself; if multiple — it lists them.
- 8.5 platform support across `cf-validate`, `cfe-validate`, `epf-validate`, `skd-validate`.

#### `skd-info`

- Field detail view (`-Mode fields -Name <Field>`) prints kv role parameters (`balanceGroupName`, `balanceType`, `accountTypeExpression`, …) on the Role line.
- Section `query` of `-Mode full` prints external dataset names when no queries exist (no more anonymous "(no query datasets)").

## subsystem-manage.md

### Upstream sync `2026-07-30`

Scripts refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills): `subsystem-compile` v1.5 → **v1.9**, `subsystem-edit` v1.2 → **v1.7**, `subsystem-info` v1.0 → **v1.2**, `subsystem-validate` → **v1.2**.

- **Support gate** — `subsystem-compile` / `subsystem-edit` refuse to modify subsystems of a locked typical configuration; see [support-manage.md](support-manage.md).
- **`subsystem-info`** — prints the support state of the subsystem.

### Earlier Additions (upstream `w-2026-05-17`)

The PowerShell scripts under `tools/1c-subsystem-manage/scripts/` were refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills). Highlights:

- **`subsystem-compile` / `subsystem-edit`** — content of a subsystem accepts Russian and plural prefixes (`Справочник`, `Справочники`, `Catalogs`) and normalises them to the canonical `Catalog`. `subsystem-validate` flags surviving plural forms as an error.
- **Stub-files for child subsystems** are created automatically when the parent declares a child. Previously the `<Subsystems>` reference existed but the file did not — the platform silently ignored it, and stricter loaders started failing.
- Subsystem `objects` accepts `content` as a synonym (and vice versa).
- Validators got the universal improvements described in `role-manage.md` → "Recent Additions" (one-liner output by default, `-Detailed`, folder path auto-resolution).

## template-manage.md

### Local fix `2026-09-13` — object XML paths

`add-template.ps1 -ObjectName` accepts absolute and relative object XML paths and places the template beside the resolved object. Name-only configuration lookup and the EPF `ProcessorName` alias remain supported.

### Python port of `template-remove` got the safety gate (`2026-09-09`)

`remove-template.py` — the Linux / macOS runtime of `template-remove` — shipped without the local hardening `remove-template.ps1` v1.3 carries: it accepted no `-DryRun` and deleted unconditionally without `-Force`, so the "preview first" workflow of [template-manage.md](template-manage.md) was impossible on a non-Windows host. The port now mirrors the PowerShell contract — preflight parse (the XML edit is planned and rendered before the tree is touched), a refusal when the template is not registered in `ChildObjects`, an atomic root-XML write through a temporary file, then the gate (`-DryRun` prints the plan and changes nothing; a real removal requires `-Force`, otherwise exit 2). Pinned by `tools/tests/python-ports-regression.py` with the new `epf-with-template` fixture; deltas recorded in [`NOTICE.md`](../NOTICE.md).

### Upstream sync `2026-07-30`

Scripts refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills): `template-add` v1.5 → **v1.10**, `template-remove` → **v1.3**. `template-add` enforces the vendor support gate — it refuses to add a template to a locked object of a typical configuration ([support-manage.md](support-manage.md)). `template-remove` keeps the local hardening (preflight parse, atomic root-XML write, `-DryRun` / `-Force`).

## web-manage.md

### Upstream sync `2026-07-30`

Scripts refreshed from [Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills](https://github.com/Nikolay-Shirokov/cc-1c-skills): `web-publish` v1.2 → **v1.4**; `web-info` / `web-stop` unchanged; `web-unpublish` keeps the local `-DryRun` / `-Force` safety gate.

- **OData is enabled correctly in `default.vrd`** — via the `<standardOdata enable="true"/>` child element instead of the old `enableStandardOdata` attribute, which the platform ignored. Publications that need the standard OData interface actually get it now.
- Platform path resolution follows the `db-*` chain (explicit → `.dev.env` → `.v8-project.json` → auto-detect), locally patched to also accept the version install directory shape used by `.dev.env` `PLATFORM_PATH` (resolves `bin\` for `wsap24.dll`).
