# OpenSpec

> **AI agents:** if you need to install or update project rules, go to [`AGENT-INSTALL.md`](../AGENT-INSTALL.md). This file is a human-oriented overview of the OpenSpec workspace.

Spec-driven development workspace for this project, structured per the
[Fission-AI/OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) v1.0+ workflow
(OPSX, artifact-guided).

This folder is bundled by the `1c-rules` installer (see `AGENT-INSTALL.md`,
phase **Place / Shared OpenSpec scaffold**) so every project that installs
`1c-rules` starts with a ready-to-use OpenSpec layout. The installer copies
files in **skip-if-exists** mode — your existing specs and change proposals
are never overwritten.

## Directory layout

```

## Auto-generated `project.md` (1C context)

The installer inspects the project root on every `init` and `update` and
regenerates `openspec/project.md` from real 1C metadata signals:

- `Configuration.xml` / `ConfigurationExtension.xml` — name, synonym, vendor,
  edition, `CompatibilityMode` (→ platform version), `DefaultRunMode` +
  `Use*FormIn*Application` (→ form mode: managed / ordinary / mixed),
  `NamePrefix` (→ extension marker)
- `CommonModules/СтандартныеПодсистемыСервер/Ext/Module.bsl` (or English
  `StandardSubsystemsServer`) — БСП presence;
  `CommonModules/ОбновлениеИнформационнойБазыБСП/Ext/Module.bsl`
  (`InfobaseUpdateSSL`) — БСП version (`Описание.Версия` in
  `ПриДобавленииПодсистемы`), for old БСП the literal returned by
  `Функция ВерсияБиблиотеки()` / `Function LibraryVersion()`
- `Subsystems/*.xml` — top-level subsystems
- `Catalogs/`, `Documents/`, `*Registers/`, `CommonModules/`, … — metadata
  counts

The file is tracked in `.ai-rules.json` like any other managed content. If
you edit it manually, the installer marks it `userModified` and stops
overwriting it. To pick up changes after editing `Configuration.xml`,
delete `openspec/project.md` and re-run `install.ps1 update`.

If the project is not a 1C source dump (no `Configuration.xml`), the bundled
fallback `project.md` remains with `unknown` values until real metadata is
available.

## Activating slash commands

OpenSpec slash commands (`/opsx:propose`, `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:archive`,
`/opsx:explore`, `/opsx:sync`, `/opsx:update`) and the matching SKILLs are placed automatically by the
`1c-rules` installer for every active tool — **no `npm` and no OpenSpec CLI
required at install time**. The installer ships a snapshot of `openspec init`
output under `content/openspec-bundle/<tool>/` and copies the per-tool files
during phases 6c (`init` / `add`) and *OpenSpec artefacts (update)* (`update`).
The OpenSpec CLI version of the bundled snapshot is recorded in
`.ai-rules.json` under `integrations.openspec.artifactsBundleVersion`.

After installation you should already see, depending on which tools are active:

- Cursor — `.cursor/commands/opsx-{apply,archive,explore,propose,sync,update}.md`
- Claude Code — `.claude/commands/opsx/{apply,archive,explore,propose,sync,update}.md`
- Codex — only SKILLs under `.codex/skills/openspec-*/SKILL.md` (Codex has no project slash commands; the upstream `.agents/skills/` output is remapped there)
- OpenCode — `.opencode/command/opsx-{apply,archive,explore,propose,sync,update}.md` (upstream `.opencode/commands/`, remapped to the adapter's folder)
- Kilo Code — `.kilo/commands/opsx-{apply,archive,explore,propose,sync,update}.md` (the upstream `.kilocode/workflows/` layout is remapped by the installer — see `adapters/kilocode.yaml`)

…plus matching `openspec-{propose,apply-change,archive-change,explore,sync-specs,update-change}/SKILL.md`
folders under each tool's `skills/` directory. Restart your IDE for the
slash commands to take effect.

### Refreshing to a newer OpenSpec version (optional)

The bundled snapshot is updated together with `1c-rules` releases. If you
want to jump ahead to a newer OpenSpec CLI version without waiting for the
next `1c-rules` release, install the official CLI once and run it inside
the project — it will overwrite the bundled files in place:

```bash
npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest
openspec update      # refresh slash commands and SKILLs to the current CLI version
```

This is purely optional. After a subsequent `1c-rules` update, the bundled
snapshot's version takes over again (unless you've marked the affected files
as user-modified, in which case `1c-rules` preserves your edits).

## Workflow (default core profile)

```
/opsx:propose <idea>   →  /opsx:apply   →  /opsx:archive
```

1. **propose** — AI creates `proposal.md`, delta `specs/`, `design.md`, and
   `tasks.md`. Full-cycle artifacts define an observable Definition of Done
   (DoD), with acceptance criteria and tasks for testing and review.
2. **apply** — AI implements, executes verification scenarios, reviews the final change, fixes
   blocking findings and reconciles DoD with evidence. Testing and review
   are required for full-cycle unless explicitly waived by the user; waivers
   are recorded separately from passes. CLI `all_done` / checked tasks alone
   do not establish completion. Missing verification keeps DoD incomplete.
3. **archive** — after checking DoD evidence, completed changes merge into `specs/` and the change folder
   is moved to `changes/archive/<date>-<change-name>/`.

Browser testing retains its `UI_TESTING` policy; disabling it does not cancel
other verification. The model may select the optional
[`1c-business-tests`](../content/skills/1c-business-tests/SKILL.md) or
[`1c-ui-regression`](../content/skills/1c-ui-regression/SKILL.md) skill to author
and run reusable tests when useful. Frameworks and runners must be verified in
the target project; they are not bundled or required for every change. The agent must compare
expected and actual outcomes using the supported, authorized checks within apply.
Separate reviewer agents retain their launch conditions; the
parent performs full-cycle review by default. The completion contract lives
in [`sdd-integrations.md`](../content/rules/sdd-integrations.md).

## Integration with `1c-rules`

The detailed agent-side rules for how to read and update this folder live in:

- source repository: [`content/rules/sdd-integrations.md`](../content/rules/sdd-integrations.md)
- installed project: the canonical rules directory referenced from `AGENTS.md`

That file is loaded on demand whenever an SDD framework is detected in the project.

The installer also records the presence of this folder in
`.ai-rules.json` under `integrations.openspec` so other agents can detect it
without scanning the filesystem.
